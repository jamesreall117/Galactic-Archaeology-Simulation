# Quantum-Inspired Galactic Archaeology Simulation (QIGAS)

A decentralized platform for collaborative galactic archaeology research, combining quantum-inspired algorithms with blockchain technology to reconstruct and simulate the Milky Way's evolutionary history.

## Overview

QIGAS enables researchers to collaboratively map, analyze, and simulate the Milky Way's history through a unique combination of quantum-inspired optimization algorithms and blockchain technology. The platform facilitates the sharing of stellar data, historical hypotheses, and simulation results while ensuring data integrity and proper attribution through smart contracts.

## Key Features

### Quantum-Inspired Simulation Engine
- Advanced optimization algorithms inspired by quantum computing principles
- Parallel processing of multiple historical scenarios
- Dynamic adjustment of simulation parameters based on new astronomical data
- Real-time visualization of galactic evolution models

### Blockchain Integration
- Immutable record-keeping of research contributions and discoveries
- Smart contracts for automated attribution and collaboration management
- Decentralized storage of stellar data and simulation results
- NFT-based recognition system for significant discoveries

### Collaborative Research Tools
- Real-time collaboration environment for international research teams
- Version control for simulation models and hypotheses
- Peer review and validation system
- Integrated discussion forums and annotation tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18.0 or higher
- Python 3.9+
- Quantum-inspired optimization toolkit
- Web3 wallet for blockchain interactions

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qigas.git

# Install dependencies
cd qigas
npm install

# Install Python requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration
1. Set up your Web3 wallet credentials in `.env`
2. Configure your preferred quantum simulation parameters
3. Set up database connections for stellar data

## Usage

### Running Simulations
```python
from qigas import GalacticSimulator

# Initialize simulator
simulator = GalacticSimulator(quantum_params={
    'optimization_method': 'quantum_annealing',
    'time_steps': 1000000,
    'spatial_resolution': '100pc'
})

# Run simulation
simulation = simulator.run(
    initial_state='13billion_years_ago',
    end_state='present'
)
```

### Managing Smart Contracts
```javascript
const { deployContract } = require('./blockchain/deploy');

// Deploy research contribution contract
async function deployResearchContract() {
    const contract = await deployContract('ResearchContribution', {
        initialParams: {
            researchType: 'stellar_kinematics',
            dataHash: '0x...'
        }
    });
    return contract;
}
```
